        <h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About Department</strong></h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering (EEE) (UG – PROGRAM) was&nbsp;established in the year 2005 with an intake of 60 and it is increased to 120 in the&nbsp;year 2012. The UG curriculum provides strong base to the students in Electrical and&nbsp;Electronics Engineering and provides exposure to the latest technologies. It&nbsp;emphasizes both the fundamentals of Physics (devices) and Mathematical (systems)&nbsp;sides of Electrical and Electronics Engineering as well as multi disciplinary nature of&nbsp;the field. The excellent infrastructure, teaching faculty of the best kind ensuring quality&nbsp;education such as interaction among students, parents and staff, along with a Training&nbsp;and Placement Cell ensures a bright future to its students. The department has&nbsp;conducted Workshops, Seminars, Guest lecture, Industrial &amp;amp; Field Visits, etc to&nbsp;update the Technical knowledge of students. Students are encouraged to actively&nbsp;participate in National-level technical meetings being organized at various&nbsp;engineering colleges. The department has fully equipped laboratories and facilities&nbsp;which are being used for training of undergraduate students.</p>
