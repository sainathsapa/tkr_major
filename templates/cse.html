    <h4><strong>About Department</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Department of CSE Established in the year 2005, with an intake of 240, M.Tech in CSE with an intake of 24.It has Sophisticated infrastructural, state-of-art labs and experienced faculty.&nbsp;The department is keen in academic exposure of the students to the latest domain trends by conducting a series of Seminars and workshops are organized regularly to help the faculty and students to update their knowledge about the latest tools and technologies. We give additional inputs to the students to meet the corporate needs and expectations.&nbsp;The training that we give and the syllabus we have designed for training apart from university curriculum fills the gap between the University and the Industry. It is updated regularly to keep up with the growing demands and the changing trends of the software industry and research laboratories. It helps students enhance their skills and leave the campus with a sense of total fulfillment.&nbsp;Whether it is intelligent gaming, mobile applications, IOT, cloud computing, data security, social networks, or bio-informatics the heart of CSE with action rules. In view of all these academic activities, the department has been accredited by NBA.</p>
